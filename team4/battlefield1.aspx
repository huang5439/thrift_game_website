        <h2>Production Description</h2>
        <p>Battlefield 1 takes you back to The Great War, WW1, where new technology and worldwide conflict changed the face of warfare forever.<br /> 
            Take part in every battle, control every massive vehicle, <br />
            and execute every maneuver that turns an entire fight around. The whole world is at war – see what’s beyond the trenches.<br />
          Key Features:<br />
        Changing environments in locations all over the world. <br />
            Discover every part of a global conflict from shore to shore – fight in besieged French cities, great open spaces in the Italian Alps, or vast Arabian deserts. <br />
            Fully destructible environments and ever-changing weather create landscapes that change moment to moment; <br />
            whether you’re tearing apart fortifications with gunfire or blasting craters in the earth, no battle is ever the same.<br />
              Huge multiplayer battles. <br />
            Swarm the battlefield in massive multiplayer battles with up to 64 players. <br />
            Charge in on foot as infantry, lead a cavalry assault, and battle in fights so intense and complex you'll need the help of all your teammates to make it through.<br />
                Game-changing vehicles. Turn the tide of battle in your favour with vehicles both large and larger, <br />
            from tanks and biplanes to gigantic Behemoths, unique and massive vehicles that will be critical in times of crisis. <br />
            Rain fire from the sky in a gargantuan Airship, tear through the world in the Armored Train, or bombard the land from the sea in the Dreadnought.<br />
                A new Operations multiplayer mode. In Operations mode, execute expert manoeuvres in a series of inter-connected multiplayer battles spread across multiple maps. <br />
            Attackers must break through the defense line and push the conflict onto the next map, and defenders must try to stop them. <br />
